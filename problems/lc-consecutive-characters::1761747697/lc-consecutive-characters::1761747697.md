## Problem Statement

The **power** of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string `s`, return _the **power** of_ `s`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 500`

	- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

```Python3
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        mc = c = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i-1]:
                c+= 1
                mc = max(mc,c)
            else:
                c = 1
        return mc
```
